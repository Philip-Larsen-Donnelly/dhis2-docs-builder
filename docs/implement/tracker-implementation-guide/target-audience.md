# Target audience 

The target audience for this guide are those who are wondering if DHIS2 Tracker is the right fit for their needs, and for those working with planning, budgeting, or managing a Tracker implementation. This includes prospective system owners, project managers, decision makers, and donors, as well as those responsible for configuration, training and support. The guidance in this document was derived from a number of existing use cases, which are referenced throughout. It should be referred to in conjunction with the rest of the documentation found at docs.dhis2.org.

Recommended changes and improvements to this guide can be made by following the process described [in the DHIS2 github](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docs/blob/master/src/commonmark/en/content/common/submitting-a-doc-fix.md).
